Install FFmpeg On Ubuntu 16.04, Via Apt-Get (Command Line)

Use the following commands on your terminal to install FFmpeg 3.1.3 on Ubuntu 16.04 Systems.
The same procedure can be followed for Ubuntu 15.04, Ubuntu 14.04 and other Ubuntu Derivatives.

Method 1
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/ffmpeg-3
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg libav-tools x264 x265

Method 2
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:djcj/hybrid
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

Method 3
This method to install ffmpeg depends on the version of Ubuntu you have install.
For recent supported versions (i.e. 15.04 , 16.04 & 16.10 currently), this method should work and will get ffmpeg from the offical repositories.
Just type the following command on your terminal:

sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

But if you are using 14.04 (and some other version near it), you can use libav-tools a fork of that project.
The reason is because ffmpeg was removed from the offical ubuntu repositories for a few versions.
So type the following command on your terminal:
sudo apt-get install libav-tools


Once installed use the FFmpeg to convert video nad audio files on Linux Ubuntu Systems.
